                <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Mr. Jeffry had just explained the concept of science fair to the class, and none of us were impressed. What was the point of working on a project for months that wouldn't have any real impact? We were hardly listening when he added a few words.</p>
                <p>"There is another option," he said. "If you're really into science or building things, then you could try out for Science Olympiad." He described it further in a very convoluted manner. But a few of his words stuck: "If you're interested, know that you can't kind of half participate; they expect a lot, so you go all in. And our team... is pretty dang good." I had no idea what this Science Olympiad club was, but I was intruiged, so I tried out and made the team. With those few words, Mr. Jeffry set the path for the next four years of my life. His short tangent was the spark that came to define my entire high school experience, and without him, I would have been a different person.</p>
                <p>After I joined, I soon learned that our club did not "expect a lot," nor was it "pretty dang good." But in the next three years, I changed that, and now C. G. Woodson Science Olympiad has one of the highest medal counts in the state and has defeated three Nationals-qualifying schools. And beyond its notable performance, we have cultivated a tight-knight web of students who lift each other to success and bask in our mutual victories. Woodson Scioly is an institution uniquely cherished by many.</p>
                <p>For this reason, it is my urge and obligation to endow the club to future leaders capable of preserving its legacy. I am the best leader our club has ever seen in its 13-year history. I hold its best personal performance record. In half the time I had to lead the team, I drove it to do better than all thirteen of my predecessors. But I will be sorely disappointed if that were to remain true for future years. So, before I leave, I hope to cultivate the next generation of leaders who feel the same as I do. Who can't fall asleep at night because they're analyzing hundreds of different policies and strategies for the club. Who give up on their classes and exams for the slightest chance at improving its performance. Who have a burning passion so strong that the club is the only thing that occupies their mind every waking moment. That is why I created this reference - to provide a unique lens into the thoughts of one zealous and deliberate President. Because I hope one of you will be able to take my mantle and mindset to preserve our invaluable club.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Motives</h3>
                <p>I walked into Mrs. Babcock's room, feeling good about myself. It was the day of Cav Kickoff, just before my sophomore year, and I was determined to do everything I could to make this Cav Kickoff great. But something caught my eye - a colorful trifold poster titled "Science Olympiad."</p>
                <p>Mrs. Babcock caught my eye and said, "It's a good poster, right?"</p>
                <p>"Yeah," I agreed. "Who made it?"</p>
                <p>"Lavanya," she said. "Didn't she do so well?"</p>
                <p>If I had Superman's eyes, the colorful printouts and aesthetic words would have burned to a black crisp right then. I felt a boiling rage inside my heart - why hadn't I made the poster? How had I not known Lavanya would make the board? <i>How did I let myself not be the best?</i></p>
                <p>The race to become President is a yearly tradition inside any club, and it's quite evident in WSO. In my sophomore year, the race was especially intense, with Lavanya, Matthew, and I fighting tooth and nail to become the next Vice President. I won, of course, but I share this story because it shows how badly I wanted to be President. Retrospectively, I was the most eager to become President, but why? I believed I was best fit to direct our club's policies, but why did I want to bother with leadership at all?</p>
                <p>Some people want to become an officer for their college application. Others view it as a reward deserved after their labors. For me, becoming President meant being the best - and I had to be the best, no matter what. It is my personal belief that anything short of perfection is failure. And to me, failure is worse than death because it reduces the worth of my life. My father belittled me as a child, making me question my worth, and so I became determined, from an early age, to be the best. Although I'm not shackled by such thoughts anymore, I developed an instinct to be at the top. I am in no way expecting anyone to adopt this mindset, but you can see I had a personal impetus for serving the club. Your goal should be to find such a reason for yourself - a higher motive, one that goes beyond putting your officer position on the Common Application. Not because Mrs. Babcock and I look are purists, but because the President's duties require them. Addressing the endless list of duties requires more than just patience. You will not make sacrifices for superficial goals. You will see no reason to innovate and trailblaze with a mere completionist mindset. To truly serve the club, it must become a part of your mind and soul.</p>
                <p>Close to the 2023 States tournament, I was talking with the current president. We were both stressed about how the team would rank, and we discussed events that might hold us back. Our words became an excited frenzy, and soon we were practically begging, to no one, that Woodson would do well. At one point, I couldn't hold my emotions back anymore.</p>
                <p>"I just want us to do better," I exclaimed. "I don't know why, but we just <i>need</i>  to go to Nationals."</p>
                <p>Hopefully, you already have such an urge to push our team forward. But find out what specifically inside you provides that momentum. Understand what force is driving you, and it will push you further than anyone else.</p>
                <p><b>Takeaway: </b>A President must have a driving force. It can't be as simple as getting lots of medals, but a part of who you are that can push you through struggles to success.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Leadership</h3>
                <p>My creation of the Executive Board in my sophomore year was a deliberate, premeditated act to concentrate the leadership team's power into my own hands. I made my Roadmap to Nationals in private because I was wary of opposition by other club leaders. I was only a junior, and Sophia was a higher-ranked officer. In addition, the rest of the officers had just as much influence as I did. With the traditional system, we were all on the same playing field, except for Sophia, and my changes could be severely limited by my peers or my superior officer.</p>
                <p>So, I subverted the authority of my senior officers by establishing the Board. This had a number of outcomes. First, the creation of the Board eliminated the influence of all other States members. Traditionally, States members provided input into the club's decision-making, but this was eliminated by making everyone except for the President, Vice President, and Secretary replaceable. The Executive Board also equalized the power of its three members. Since management of the club was given to the Board, not its members, the power distribution was initially even. However, three people are a lot more easier to manage than fifteen. Because I was able to become the leader of the Executive Board, I was virtually unrestricted to direct policy changes while being Vice President and a mere junior.
                <p>I did not analyze every aspect of the Executive Board before implementing it. However, I did have an idea of its impacts beforehand. The Executive Board was not an innovative leadership structure, but a means of change that I saw fit for the club. I will discuss this soon, but realize that I only implemented my policies because I thought they were the best and only ways to go forward. Otherwise, the temporary Executive Board, the pairing event system, and States replacement would have been a farce.</p>
                <p>Leadership is not the ability to give orders or get people to do things they don't want to do. True leadership stems from either an unstoppable desire to serve; a leader is wholly unqualified if they lack this. The ability to lead can obviously improve over time, however. I learned several things while trying to lead the club as a junior, and my leadership skills gradually improved. One of my critical lessons was being a better communicator; a leader must speak clearly and ensure that their message is understood. This means an emphasis in quality over quantity. In my junior year, I sent out countless documents and references to the entire team. I didn't clearly explain what each was for, because there were so many things. However, by limiting the number of documents and files our members needed to keep track of, I made the flow of information more streamlined. Another critical component of leadership is maintaining a cordial relationship with your followers. I was too cold and unapproachable (and still am sometimes) while Vice President, and this limited my ability to direct and help individuals. There was one incident at the Princeton Invitational that made this clear for me. I was working at a table in the hotel lobby, and one of our States members was looking for a place to study. I offered them my spot, but they looked flustered and hustled away without a word. I intimidated people as a leader, and this was detrimental to our overall club dynamic.</p>
                <p>My poor relationship with the club members last year were the result of both my personality and my policies. The replacement system is completely necessary, but because I took away States members' ability to share their thoughts, many were terrified of being replaced. One student even considered drafting a declaration of independence for APUSH about Science Olympiad and myself. I first thought my harsh leadership was necessary, but I realized that the stress and the inability to speak one's mind was terrible to our team dynamic. That is why I took a step back on concentrating decision-making influence. I told my States members that we are a big "family" and that everyone would give input on our decisions this year in the hopes that our States dynamic would be stronger and more effective. Because true motivation, as it goes for leadership, contributes the most to the performance of the team.</p>
                <p>I have one additional admission. After the 2024 season ended, I didn't like the idea of having to share power with a Vice President and Secretary. I wanted my decision-making to be unregulated, as it had been in my junior year. So, I dissolved the Executive Board, which put most of the power back into my own hands. But of course, this was because I believed my leadership would be best for the club and help us most for our best season yet.</p>
                <p>Doing the best for the club requires realizing that you make mistakes. Your ideal solution for WSO will have flaws. But a true leader will be able to identify them, take responsibility, and fix them. There is no perfect leader. Every leader makes blunders, and each President can do a little more for the club. <i>You will never be enough as a leader.</i> But acknowledging this and doing your best will ultimately help the club. That is why I believe the pains of the Executive Board and the poor States team dynamic of the 2024 season were more than unnecessary pain. They were growth pains that pushed us further, that were necessary for our betterment.</p>
                <p><b>Takeaway: </b>Leadership is the means of doing what is right for the club.</p>
