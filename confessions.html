                <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Mr. Jeffry had just explained the concept of science fair to the class, and none of us were impressed. What was the point of working on a project for months that wouldn't have any real impact? We were hardly listening when he added a few words.</p>
                <p>"There is another option," he said. "If you're really into science or building things, then you could try out for Science Olympiad." He described it further in a very convoluted manner. But a few of his words stuck: "If you're interested, know that you can't kind of half participate; they expect a lot, so you go all in. And our team... is pretty dang good." I had no idea what this Science Olympiad club was, but I was intruiged, so I tried out and made the team. With those few words, Mr. Jeffry set the path for the next four years of my life. His short tangent was the spark that came to define my entire high school experience, and without him, I would have been a different person.</p>
                <p>After I joined, I soon learned that our club did not "expect a lot," nor was it "pretty dang good." But in the next three years, I changed that, and now C. G. Woodson Science Olympiad has one of the highest medal counts in the state and has defeated three Nationals-qualifying teams. And beyond its notable performance, we have cultivated a tight-knight web of students who lift each other to success and bask in our mutual victories. Woodson Scioly is an institution uniquely cherished by many.</p>
                <p>For this reason, it is my urge and obligation to endow the club to future leaders capable of preserving its legacy. I am the best leader our club has ever seen in its 13-year history. I hold its best personal performance record. In half the time I gave myself to lead, I drove the team to do better than all thirteen of my predecessors. But I will be sorely disappointed if that were to remain true for future years. So, before I leave, I hope to cultivate the next generation of leaders who feel the same as I do. Who can't fall asleep at night because they're analyzing hundreds of different policies and strategies for the club. Who give up on their classes and exams for the slightest chance at improving its performance. Who have a burning passion so strong that the club is the only thing that occupies their mind every waking moment. That is why I created this reference - to provide a unique lens into the thoughts of one zealous and deliberate President. Because I hope one of you will be able to take my mantle and mindset to preserve our invaluable club.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Motives</h3>
                <p>I walked into Mrs. Babcock's room, feeling good about myself. It was the day of Cav Kickoff, just before my sophommore year, and I was determined to do everything I could for the club. But something caught my eye - a colorful trifold poster titled "Science Olympiad."</p>
                <p>Mrs. Babcock caught my eye and said, "It's a good poster, right?"</p>
                <p>"Yeah," I agreed. "Who made it?"</p>
                <p>"Lavanya," she said. "Didn't she do so well?"</p>
                <p>If I had Superman's eyes, the colorful printouts and aesthetic words would have burned to a black crisp right then. I felt a boiling rage inside my heart - why hadn't I made the poster? How had I not known Lavanya would make the board? <i>How did I let myself not be the best?</i></p>
                <p>The race to become President is a yearly tradition inside any club, and it's quite evident in WSO. In my sophomore year, the race was especially intense, with Lavanya, Matthew, and I fighting tooth and nail to become the next Vice President. I won, of course, but I share this story now because it provides a glimpse into the magnitude of my personal drive. Retrospectively, I was the most eager to become President, but why? I believed I was best fit to direct our club's policies, but why did I want to bother with leadership at all?</p>
                <p>Some people want to become an officer for their college application. Others view it as a reward deserved after their labors. For me, becoming President meant being the best - and I had to be the best, no matter what. It is my personal belief that anything short of perfection is failure. And to me, failure is worse than death because it reduces the worth of my life. My father belittled me as a child, making me question my worth, and so I became determined, from an early age, to be the best. Although I'm not shackled by such thoughts anymore, I developed an instinct to be at the top. I am in no way expecting anyone to adopt this mindset, but you can see I had a personal impetus for serving the club. Your goal should be to find such a reason for yourself - a higher motive, one that goes beyond putting your officer position on the Common Application. Not because Mrs. Babcock and I look are purists, but because the duties of becoming President require them. Addressing the endless list of duties requires more than just patience. You will not make sacrifices for superficial goals. You will see no reason to innovate and trailblaze with a mere completionist mindset. To truly serve the club, it must become a part of your soul and mind.</p>
                <p>Close to the 2023 States tournament, I was talking with the current president. We were both stressed about how the team would rank, and we discussed events that might hold us back. Our words became an excited frenzy, and soon we were practically begging, to no one, that Woodson would do well. At one point, I couldn't hold my emotions back anymore.</p>
                <p>"I just want us to do better," I exclaimed. "I don't know why, but I just <i>need</i> us to go to Nationals."</p>
                <p>Hopefully, you already have such an urge to push our team forward. But find out what specifically inside you provides that momentum. Understand what force is driving you, and it will push you further than anyone else.</p>
                <p><b>Takeaway: </b>A President must have a driving force. It can't be as simple as earning high rankings or lots of medals, but a true motive that is part of who you are.</p>
